This module provides helper classes to handle the computation of
reaction rates in chemical networks. They provide generic ways of
computing reaction rates from 2-body reactions, photoreactions, and
cosmic ray-induced rections, and allow users to create chemical

    This class provides a generic driver for computing rates of change
    of chemical species from chemical reactions. This class does the
    work of mapping from the reaction rates to rates of change in
    species abundances.

    Parameters
       specList: listlike of string
          List of all chemical species in the full reaction network,
          including those that are derived from conservation laws
          instead of being computed directly
       reactions : list of dict
          A list listing all the reactions to be registered; each
          entry in the list must be a dict containing the keys 'spec'
          and 'stoich', which list the species involved in the
          reaction and the stoichiometric factors for each species,
          respectively. Sign convention is that reactants on the left
          hand side have negative stoichiometric factors, those on the
          right hand side have positive factors.
       sparse : bool
          If True, the reaction rate matrix is represented as a
          sparse matrix; otherwise it is a dense matrix. This has no
          effect on results, but depending on the chemical network it
          may lead to improved execution speed and/or reduced memory
          usage.

    Examples
       To describe the reaction C + O -> CO, the correct dict entry is::

          { 'spec' : ['C', 'O', 'CO'], 'stoich' : [-1, -1, 1] }

class gr_reactions(reaction_matrix):

    The gr_reactions class is used to handle computation of reaction
    rates where some of the reactions are grain-catalyzed, and thus

        This creates a photoreaction rate computation class, for
        computing rates for reactions of the form gamma + ... ->
        ...

        Parameters
        ----------
        specList: listlike of string
           List of all chemical species in the full reaction network,
           including those that are derived from conservation laws
           instead of being computed directly
        reactions : list of dict
           A list listing all the reactions to be registered; each
           entry in the list must be a dict containing the keys:
              'spec' : list of the species involved in the reaction
              'stoich' : stoichiometric factor for each species
              'grain' : (optional) if this key exists and is True, the
                 reaction is grain catalyzed and the rate scales as
                 the dust abundance; if this key is absent, the
                 reaction is assumed not to be grain-mediated
        sparse : bool
           If True, the reaction rate matrix is represented as a
           sparse matrix; otherwise it is a dense matrix. This has no
           effect on results, but depending on the chemical network it
           may lead to improved execution speed and/or reduced memory
           usage.

        Returns
        -------
        Nothing

        Notes
        -----
        Important note on grain-mediated reactions: these are assumed
        to have rates that scale as n_1 * n_gr instead of n_1 * n_2,
        where n_i is the number density of reactant i and n_gr is the
        number density of grains. This means that the rates of
        grain-mediated reactions occur at a rate that depends only on
        the first reactant in the reactant list, rather than all
        reactants.
