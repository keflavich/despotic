This module contains methods that can be used to compute the

    Set the chemical abundances for a cloud to their equilibrium
    values, computed using a specified chemical netowrk.

    Parameters
       cloud : class cloud
          cloud on which computation is to be performed
       tEqGuess : float
          a guess at the timescale over which equilibrium will be
          achieved; if left unspecified, the code will attempt to
          estimate this time scale on its own
       network : chemNetwork class
          a valid chemNetwork class; this class must define the
          methods __init__, dxdt, and applyAbundances; if None, the
          existing chemical network for the cloud is used
       info : dict
          a dict of additional initialization information to be passed
          to the chemical network class when it is instantiated
       addEmitters : Boolean
          if True, emitters that are included in the chemical
          network but not in the cloud's existing emitter list will
          be added; if False, abundances of emitters already in the
          emitter list will be updated, but new emiters will not be
          added to the cloud
       evolveTemp : 'fixed' | 'iterate' | 'iterateDust' | 'gasEq' | 'fullEq' | 'evol'
          how to treat the temperature evolution during the chemical
          evolution:

          * 'fixed' = treat tempeature as fixed
          * 'iterate' = iterate between setting the gas temperature and
            chemistry to equilibrium
          * 'iterateDust' = iterate between setting the gas and dust
            temperatures and the chemistry to equilibrium
          * 'gasEq' = hold dust temperature fixed, set gas temperature to
            instantaneous equilibrium value as the chemistry evolves
          * 'fullEq' = set gas and dust temperatures to instantaneous
            equilibrium values while evolving the chemistry network
          * 'evol' = evolve gas temperature in time along with the
            chemistry, assuming the dust is always in instantaneous
            equilibrium

       isobaric : Boolean
          if set to True, the gas is assumed to be isobaric during the
          evolution (constant pressure); otherwise it is assumed to be
          isochoric; note that (since chemistry networks at present are
          not allowed to change the mean molecular weight), this option
          has no effect if evolveTemp is 'fixed'
       tempEqParam : None | dict
          if this is not None, then it must be a dict of values that
          will be passed as keyword arguments to the cloud.setTempEq,
          cloud.setGasTempEq, or cloud.setDustTempEq routines; only used
          if evolveTemp is not 'fixed'
       dEdtParam : None | dict
          if this is not None, then it must be a dict of values that
          will be passed as keyword arguments to the cloud.dEdt
          routine; only used if evolveTemp is 'evol'
       tol : float
          tolerance requirement on the equilibrium solution
       convList : list
          list of species to include when calculating tolerances to
          decide if network is converged; species not listed are not
          considered. If this is None, then all species are considered
          in deciding if the calculation is converged.
       smallabd : float
          abundances below smallabd are not considered when checking for
          convergence; set to 0 or a negative value to consider all
          abundances, but beware that this may result in false
          non-convergence due to roundoff error in very small abundances
       maxTempIter : int
          maximum number of iterations when iterating between chemistry
          and temperature; only used if evolveTemp is 'iterate' or
          'iterateDust'
       verbose : Boolean
          if True, diagnostic information is printed as the calculation
          proceeds

    Returns
       converged : Boolean
          True if the calculation converged, False if not

    Raises
       despoticError, if network is None and the cloud does not already
       have a defined chemical network associated with it

    Remarks
       The final abundances are written to the cloud whether or not the
       calculation converges.
